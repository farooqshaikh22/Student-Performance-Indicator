## Project Overview

The Student Performance Indicator project is designed to analyze various factors influencing student performance, such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and test preparation. By applying machine learning algorithms, this project predicts student success and provides actionable insights for educators and administrators to support student growth and achievement.

## Features

- Individual Student Prediction: Predicts the academic performance of individual students based on input data.
- Batch Prediction: Allows bulk analysis of student data through CSV file uploads, enabling efficient decision-making processes for educational institutions.
- Modular Coding: Utilizes modular coding principles for code maintainability and scalability.
- Web Interface: Implements a user-friendly web interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS for seamless interaction with the predictive models.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
- **File Structure**:
  - `src/`: Contains source code files
  - `Prediction/`: Module for batch prediction functionality
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for web interface
  - `batch_prediction/`: Directory for uploaded CSV files
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for a list of required dependencies.
